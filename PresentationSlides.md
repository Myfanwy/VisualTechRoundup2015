* Git manages and stores revisions of projects.
* Mostly used for code, but can be used to manage any other type of file.
    - Like a filing system for every draft of a document.
* If you want to make a change to a project, you copy the whole project repository to your own system,
  make your changes on that local copy, then you "check in" the changes to the central server.

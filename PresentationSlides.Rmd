## So here's what we're going to do:

 1) Making better/more effective graphs
      - Enormous topic
      - I'll show you a few examples of some graphs you may not have seen before
      - You will have access to the literal source code of everything I show you.

 2) **Brief** introduction to Git/GitHub


 3) **Brief** introduction to rmarkdown

 4) An actual workflow, from start to finish (kinda).

## A windy road

It's not perfect yet




## The First thing you need to know about: GitHub

* A user-friendly wrapper for Git

## What is Git?

* An open source version control project started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds.
* Git manages and stores revisions of projects.
* Mostly used for code, but can be used to manage any other type of file.
    - Like a filing system for every draft of a document.
* If you want to make a change to a project, you copy the whole project repository to your own system,
  make your changes on that local copy, then you "check in" the changes to the central server.
  
## Okay so what is GitHub again?

* GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds a ton of other features.
* Git = command line tool
* GitHub = web-based graphical user interface (GUI)
* Provides access control and several collaboration features.

Project:

First chapter of your dissertation.

Step 1) Create an .rproj (Ch1.rproj) on your local directory (typically the one with all the files you want associated already in the directory)
 - select "Create Git Repository" option.

Step 2) load data, tidy data, analyze data, and create some figures.

Step 3) Copy and paste r script into several .rmd files:
  	a) PDF/LaTeX
		b) HTML
		c) Presentation

Step5) Create a ShinyApp, if you like

Step 4) Push to GitHub using Git Software or the website itself ("Publish Repository")

Step 5) Clone to desktop again for revising.
